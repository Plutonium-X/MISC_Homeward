===============================
I.     Overview
===============================

This mod allows the player to return his or her BioWare companions from the Pocket Plane 
to their homes in Amn. It also allows them to be re-summoned. This mod also allows the player
to send his or her BioWare companions home from Brynnlaw. They can be recruited again on the
mainland. An optional component prevents BioWare romances from being killed by separation
caused by sending them home from Brynnlaw.

==============================
II.    Compatibility
==============================

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate 2, Shadows of Amn, with the Throne of Bhaal expansion.

Now, it work also with BG2EE, but it don't work for the BG2EE new companions.

There are no known incompatibilities with any mod.

==============================
IV.   Playing the Mod
==============================

Talk to the Fate Spirit in the Pocket Plane with the companions you wish to return to Amn in your party. 
Only companions that have been returned home through the Fate Spirit may be recalled to the Pocket Plane. 
You will also have the opportunity to hear what befell your former companions shortly before 
you would ordinarily expect the epilogues of your current companions.

To send companions home from Brynnlaw, speak with Captain Ruby. She's standing on the lower docks, not 
far from where the duel takes place. Her first mate, Jasmine, sells a variety of useful (and not-so-useful)
items.
